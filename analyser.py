user_entry='''Today felt like a rollercoaster of emotions. The morning started off on a high note—I received an email confirming my promotion at work, something I’ve been working towards for the past year. I felt a surge of excitement and pride. It was a moment of validation for all the hard work and late nights. I decided to treat myself to a nice breakfast, basking in the glow of my accomplishment.
                But, as the day progressed, a cloud seemed to hover over me. I had a long and draining meeting in the afternoon. Discussions went in circles, and it felt like we were not making any progress. The frustration from the meeting lingered longer than I expected, casting a shadow over my earlier joy.
                Later in the evening, I went for a walk to clear my head. The park was serene, with the gentle rustling of leaves and distant laughter of children playing. It was a bittersweet feeling—peaceful yet tinged with the day’s earlier frustrations. I couldn’t shake off a sense of loneliness, wondering why I didn’t have someone to share my day's ups and downs with.'''
